TimeSeriesComp
==============

The purpose of this package is to create a scalable method for determining the relative performance of certain stocks / portfolios to a benchmark.

By allowing a user to specify a benchmark, as well as include a certain set of stocks within their portfolio, they are able to receive granular level data which can help to better inform their future investment decisions.

The benefit of benchmarking is also that it can be used in order to tell investors whether or not they are under / outperforming the model portfolio they are attempting to mirror.
